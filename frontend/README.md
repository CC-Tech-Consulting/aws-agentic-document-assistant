The solution includes two options for setting up a UI for experimentation, development, and demonstrations:

* Use the `amplify-ui` if you are looking for a standalone full-featured chat user experience.
* Use the `streamlit-ui` app if you are looking for a basic chat user experience, namely for quick demonstrations and testing.

Follow the instructions in `streamlit-ui/README.md` to setup the streamlit agentic assistant demo.
Or follow the insturctions in `amplify-ui/README.md` to setup a standalone web app for the agentic assistant.
